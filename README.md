## Overview

This is a Python implementation of the classic Snake Game using the Turtle graphics module. The game involves controlling a snake to eat food that appears randomly on the screen. Each time the snake eats the food, it grows longer, and the player's score increases. The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or with its own tail.

## Features

- Responsive snake controlled by arrow keys.
- Randomly appearing food that the snake can eat.
- Scoreboard to track the player's score.
- Game over condition when the snake collides with the wall or itself.
